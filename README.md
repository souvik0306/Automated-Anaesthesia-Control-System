## IoT-Based Anaesthesia Control and Monitoring System

## Abstract - 
Anaesthesia influence is a state of controlled hypnosis induced during surgeries to relieve pain and to allow surgeons to carry out operations. During surgery, an anaesthetist administers a drug per its requirement, however, human error accounts for a number of fatalities. The incorrect dosage of anaesthesia can cause diplopia, respiratory arrest, brain damage, or even death, with their effects varying with each patient. This paper presents an automated anaesthesia control system interfaced with a mobile application to allow the exchange of real-time vitals using the Internet of Things (IoT). The dosage for anaesthesia is regulated by evaluating body parameters like blood pressure, heart rate, blood oxygen level, and body temperature. These readings are then sent to a microcontroller (Arduino UNO) where they are analysed. The appropriate dosage will be defined by age, weight, and medical history of the patient. The system can be used for any surgery involving anaesthesia. A detailed approach is provided to reduce human errors and offers a convenient way to maintain a robust record-keeping and monitoring system for any hospital. This data may be loaded into any cloud storage facility for future use or accessibility. With this compact system, fatalities prompted by human errors can be reduced.
